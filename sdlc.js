// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirments
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis = "In this step you will go over the plan and see what is required to complete it and how you would go about meeting those requirments, usually ran by the product manager."
const design = "In this step you will go over the design of the software, usually done by the system architect. "
const implementation = "This step is where the front and back end developers will start developing the software."
const testingAndintegration = "Once all the other steps have been completed you can begin testing for bugs and also test to make sure all the requirments have been met."
const maintain = "This is the final step of the development lifecycle where you will maintain the program until the software is no longer usable"
